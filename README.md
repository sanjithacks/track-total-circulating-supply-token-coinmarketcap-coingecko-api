Have you submitted or going to submit your project on **COINMARKETCAP** and **COINGECKO**.
Then, you may heard about

API endpoint that displays ONLY **TOTAL SUPPLY** as a NUMERICAL value
example:
`https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ric/api.dws?q=totalcoins`

API endpoint that displays ONLY **Circulating Supply** as a numerical value
example: 
`https://chainz.cryptoid.info/ric/api.dws?q=circulating`
